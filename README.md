## Requirements

You will only need Node.js and a node global package, npm, installed in your environment.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, make sure to have `git` available in your PATH, as `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install Node.js and npm easily with apt install. Just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! 

    $ npm install npm -g
